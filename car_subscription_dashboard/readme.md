🚗 **Car Subscription Service Dashboard**

This repository contains a quick mock-up dashboard I created for an interview to demonstrate my understanding of key <br>business intelligence metrics and dashboard design.

<br>

**📌 Project Overview**

For this project, I simulated a basic data pipeline from dataset creation to dashboard visualization:

📊 Data Generation: Used Python to create a dummy dataset representing a car subscription service.

🗄️ Data Storage: Imported the dataset as a CSV file into Google BigQuery.

🛠️ Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed and cleaned the data when moving it from staging to production tables.

📈 Dashboard Creation: Connected BigQuery to Google Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to design an interactive <br>KPI and analysis dashboard.

🎨 Dashboard Design: Focused on metrics that align with the business model and ensured a design consistent with <br>the brand’s identity.

<br>

**🎯 Purpose**

This project was designed as a proof of concept rather than a production-ready solution. The goal was to showcase:

✅ My ability to identify relevant business metrics.

✅ My skills in data extraction, transformation, and visualisation.

✅ My approach to dashboard design and brand alignment.

<br>

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used**

🐍 Python: Data generation

🔍 Google BigQuery: Data storage and transformation

📊 Google Looker Studio: Data visualisation and dashboard design

<br>

**📝 Notes**

This project was completed under a time constraint as part of an interview preparation process. Given more time, I <br>would refine the data further, incorporate more advanced analytics, and enhance interactivity within the dashboard.
