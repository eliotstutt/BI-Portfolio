Car Subscription Service Dashboard
This repository contains a quick mock-up dashboard I created for an interview to demonstrate my understanding of key business intelligence metrics and dashboard design.

Project Overview
For this project, I simulated a data pipeline from dataset creation to dashboard visualization:

Data Generation: Used Python to create a dummy dataset representing a car subscription service.

Data Storage: Imported the dataset as a CSV file into Google BigQuery.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed and cleaned the data when moving it from staging to production tables.

Dashboard Creation: Connected BigQuery to Google Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to design an interactive KPI and analysis dashboard.

Dashboard Design: Focused on metrics that align with the business model and ensured a design consistent with the brand’s identity.

Key Metrics & Features
Subscriber growth and churn rate analysis

Purpose
This project was designed as a proof of concept rather than a production-ready solution. The goal was to showcase:

My ability to identify relevant business metrics.

My skills in data extraction, transformation, and visualisation.

My approach to dashboard design and brand alignment.

Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Data generation

Google BigQuery: Data storage and transformation

Google Looker Studio: Data visualisation and dashboard design

Notes
This project was completed under a time constraint as part of an interview preparation process. Given more time, I would refine the data further, incorporate more advanced analytics, and enhance interactivity within the dashboard.
